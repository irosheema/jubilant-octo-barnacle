      <p>First of all : Hi , welcome!
This is the first day of owning this blog. The efforts I’ve put onto this is so precious- as if it’s my baby.  
I wanted a place (that’s not on social media platforms) where I can reflect on my thoughts, share some ideas that come to my mind and show some of my works such as photography and drawings … The reason I wanted a place that’s not on those social media platforms where I would be sharing parts of “me” is because of their toxic environment. Lately I’ve been dealing with some mental issues and out of my anger I ended up deleting Instagram. THAT DECISION WAS SO ON POINT ! I2ve been feeling much better since that time -stopped comparing myself to what I see on social media, started eating better and focused more on my overall health. Oh and also I’ve been more productive. Considering all these positive effects I’ve seen, I definitely recommend doing so. Not a demand- a recommendation. Well, I think that’s it for now. I will be working on developing this place.
I wonder how it’s going to look like in the future… See y’all soon ^^ ! </p>
